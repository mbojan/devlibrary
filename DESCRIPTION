Description: While developing new or patching existing packages it is
	convenient to be able to load different versions of the same package.
	Standard R package library cannot store different versions of the same
	package. Package 'devlib' enables that by managing a "developers
	library" in which every package is essentially stored in its own
	library sub-tree. Wrapper functions hide all the mechanics from the
	end-user.
