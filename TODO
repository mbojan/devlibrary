Think about examples: how to sandbox example library tree?



#============================================================================ 
# adding dev library to lib paths

# NOTE On .libPaths this shouldn't be on the fist location

# 1. Create a vector of paths to package library trees. Only for most recent
# versions (from lib db extract those based on package name and version number

# 2. Put those after 1st entry in libPaths (default pkg installation
# directory), but after any other trees so that these packages are loaded first
# (?)

z <- buildLibDB(dlib1)
ind <- unlist(with(z, tapply(ver, package, order, decreasing=TRUE)))
zz <- z[ ind == 1 , ]
newpaths <- unique(path.expand(c(.libPaths()[1], zz$libloc, .Library.site, .Library)))
newpaths # ?

.libPaths(newpaths)
